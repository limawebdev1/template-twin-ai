# Template Twin AI
Feed it websites you like, create a website you love

## Project Objectives
This personal project aims to explore and gain knowledge about the technology stack behind AI products. It also allows me to leverage my cross-functional expertise in product, marketing, and software engineering. Within this repository, you will find a well-documented journey that showcases my working style, process, and more.

The project will:
- Define a problem statement
- Validate the problem statement through market research
- Identify target audiences and a go-to-market strategy
- Define a technical architecture to support a public-facing proof-of-concept
- Implement a custom AI model
- Reflect on the final proof-of-concept

Check out my Miro Board [here][def5] to see the journey!

## Problem Statement
I am excited to utilize the [Storybrand][def2] framework, which I discovered during my time at [Immutable][def] while spearheading the go-to-market efforts for portfolio games. This framework empowers me to communicate a clear and impactful message, connect with users, and serves as a valuable reference when developing go-to-market strategies.
